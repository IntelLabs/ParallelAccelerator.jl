Performance tuning is a hard problem, especially in 
high-performance scientific programs. ParallelAccelerator
is but a first step of bringing reasonable parallel performance to a
productivity language by utilizing both domain-specific and general compiler
optimization techniques without much effort from the user. However,
eventually there will be bottlenecks, and not all optimizations work in
favor of each other. ParallelAccelerator is still a proof-of-concept
at this stage and we hope to hear from all users. We welcome bug reports and code contributions. 
Please feel free to use our system, fork the project, contact us by email, and
file bug reports on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl/issues)
