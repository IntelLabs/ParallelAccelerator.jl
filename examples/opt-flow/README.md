The files `opt-flow-notypes.jl` and `image-notypes.jl` implement a version of Horn-Schunck optical flow that is identical to that implemented in `opt-flow.jl` and `image.jl`, except without type annotations.  Performance of the two versions under ParallelAccelerator is comparable.  This is intended to demonstrate that type annotations are unnecessary to achieve good performance with ParallelAccelerator, so long as Julia can infer concrete types for the code.  (Nevertheless, type annotations are useful for code maintenance and readability, especially for programs of more than a couple hundred lines, such as this one.)
